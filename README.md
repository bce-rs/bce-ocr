__Unofficial__ Baidu AI Cloud OCR SDK.

## To start...

You need to apply for the [Baidu AI Cloud API](https://cloud.baidu.com).

Currently it's free for personal use, though with limitation.

You should check [official api document](https://cloud.baidu.com/doc/OCR/s/Ek3h7xypm) for limitaion. However they only provide Chinese version yet. [DeepL](https://deepl.com/translator) helps.

We may not describe every file upload limitation in English, but you can try to know limitation without understanding Chinese.
