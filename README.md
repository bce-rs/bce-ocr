UNOFFICIAL Baidu AI Cloud OCR SDK, currently WIP.

To use this SDK, you need to apply for [Baidu AI Cloud API](https://cloud.baidu.com). Currently it's free for personal use.

You should check [api document](https://cloud.baidu.com/doc/OCR/s/Ek3h7xypm) on Baidu. They provide Chinese version only yet.

We may describe file upload limitation in English, but you can try to know limitation without understanding Chinese.
There is only resolution limit, size limit and format limit actually.
